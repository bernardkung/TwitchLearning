#### Introduction
This is a series of notebooks with the goal of gathering insight into user behavior using chat logs from the live streaming website Twitch. It also provides an excellent opportunity in practicing analytics and machine learning in the Python environment.

#### Description
Twitch is a live streaming website primarily focused on gaming, and is also used to stream gaming tournaments such as the Overwatch League, a professional competitive Overwatch tournament modelled on professional sports seasons. My primary focus will be on a series of chat logs from the Overwatch League broadcast games.

Twitch also features a live chat where users can interact with the streamer and other users. Twitch chat is built off an old communication protocol called IRC, and can still be accessed using IRC clients. My raw data consists of chat logs from an IRC client called Hexchat.
